## Deep Learning and Software Synthesisers
##### <span style="font-family:Helvetica Neue; font-weight:bold"><span style="color:#e49436">Artificial Assistants</span> That Program Synthesisers</span>

---

## Motivations
<br>
- AI that makes VSTs produce a desired sound |
- Enables the user to focus on music |

---

## Objectives
<br>
- Hacking with VSTs hosted in Python |
- Can neural networks can learn to program synthesisers? |
- Compare neural networks against other optimisation techniques |

---

## Methodologies
<br>
- Host VST in Python |
    - C++ JUCE Library hosts VST |
    - Boost Python headers expose VST Host class to Python |
    - Create better VST host in Python using exposed class |
- Make whopping dataset of sounds and the parameters that made them |
- Train neural networks in TensorFlow on the dataset |
- Visualise results in IPython |
